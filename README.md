### Project Title: COVID-19 Data Analysis Using SQL, Python, and Tableau

#### Project Introduction:

This project is a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, leveraging the power of SQL, Python, and Tableau to extract meaningful insights from the pandemic's vast datasets. The project aims to understand the trends, patterns, and impacts of COVID-19 across different regions and time periods. By utilizing SQL for data extraction and transformation, Python for in-depth data analysis and statistical computations, and Tableau for visual storytelling, this project provides a robust framework for exploring the multifaceted dimensions of the pandemic.

The analysis includes examining key metrics such as infection rates, vaccination progress, and mortality rates, as well as visualizing these trends to make the findings more accessible and actionable. This project not only highlights the challenges posed by COVID-19 but also demonstrates how data-driven approaches can contribute to better decision-making in public health.
